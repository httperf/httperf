** Complete re-write of idleconn.c to use libevent notification system
** idleconn is now optional (--enable-idleconn)

* New in version 0.9.0:
** Re-Factored build system now builds on the following platforms
   HP-UX 11i (64-bit PA-RISC and IA-64)
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS (AMD64 and IA-64)
   SUSE Linux 10.1 (i386)
   openSUSE 10.2 (i386)
   OpenBSD 4.0 (i386)
   FreeBSD 6.0 (AMD64)
   Solaris 8 (UltraSparc 64-bit)

* New in version 0.8.1:
** Numerous bug fixes. See ChangeLog for details

* New in version 0.8:
** httperf is now released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
** Preliminary support for SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  See README for details.
** New options (see man-page for details):
	--print-reply (replaced --print-replies)
	--print-request
	--ssl
	--ssl-ciphers
	--ssl-no-reuse

* New in version 0.7:
** New options (see man-page for details):
	--add-header
	--method
	--retry-on-failure
** Bug fixes
	- fixed some segfaults in the session workload generator
	- specifying option --session-cookie when not using a session
	  workload generator now prints an error message instead of
	  core dumping

* New in version 0.6:
** New options (see man-page for details):
	--max-connections
	--max-piped-calls
	--print-replies
	--session-cookies
** Cookie support now must be requested explicitly when using a session-based
   workload generator.  To do this, specify option --session-cookie.

* New in version 0.5:

** Normal connection closing is the default again.  To request closing TCP
   connections with a RESET, specify option --close-with-reset.
** --wsesslog option added to support log-file based session
   specification (contributed by Dick Carter).
** --period option added to allow a more flexible way to specify
   session/connection interarrival time.  Unlike the --rate
   argument, this allows deterministic (fixed), uniform, and
   exponentially distributed interarrival times (contributed by Dick
   Carter).
** Various bug fixes (see ChangeLog for details).

* New in version 0.41:
** In basic statistic, rename "call" to "request".

* New in version 0.4:

   used in sending requests. 1.0 and 1.0 are the only allowed values
   for this option at this point.
** What used to be called a "session" is now called a "connection".  This
   reduces confusion between TCP connections and user sessions.
** Stephane's log-file based URL generated has been added.
** The session workload generator now supports the --burst-length
   parameter to generate bursty session.
